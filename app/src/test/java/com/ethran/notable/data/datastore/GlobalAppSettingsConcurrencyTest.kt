/**
 * Regression tests for the "Unsupported concurrent change during composition" crash.
 *
 * [GlobalAppSettings.current] is a Compose snapshot state that is read all over the UI during
 * composition, while [GlobalAppSettings.update] is invoked from background coroutines. Updating the
 * snapshot state directly from a non-composition thread used to race the recomposer and crash.
 * [GlobalAppSettings.update] now commits inside a global mutable snapshot, which must make
 * concurrent background writes safe against concurrent reads.

     * background threads attempt to apply to the global snapshot simultaneously. This still
     * validates that guarded writes do not crash concurrent readers.
